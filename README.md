### Notes:
- I added **GitHub social badges** for stars and forks at the top for a professional touch.
- The screenshots are displayed side-by-side centered using simple HTML `<div>` with inline styles for spacing and sizing.
- The text is more concise and uses consistent emojis for a friendly vibe.

- Privacy and contribution sections emphasized to build trust and community engagement.
